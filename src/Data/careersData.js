First Call is a collaborative endeavor that launched in 2021 with the goal of preventing unnecessary entry into the dependency court and foster care system. One of the first of its kind in California, this attorney-led interdisciplinary team offers crucial early access to legal advice and resources designed to assist parents who are at risk of having their children removed.","With its expansion, the full team will consist of two attorneys, two social workers, and three mentor parents with lived child welfare experience. First Call’s interdisciplinary team takes a creative, holistic approach to pre-petition advocacy and family-strengthening, focusing on parents who have been contacted by the Department of Family and Children’s Services (DFCS) within the last 12 months or who are currently receiving informal DFCS services.","The First Call attorney will provide the following core services: (1) brief consult and advice calls with eligible parents, (2) “know your rights” community presentations about the child welfare system, and (3) limited scope representation to assist with family stabilization and address specific areas of vulnerability such as housing instability, substance use disorder, mental health and domestic violence issues. The attorney will provide legal assistance and limited scope representation in a variety of civil legal matters, with an emphasis on probate and family law matters if the child is at risk of DFCS involvement. If a formal DFCS petition is filed, the First Call attorney may represent the parent through the beginning stages of their legal case in dependency court. When appropriate, there will be a warm hand off to the parent’s ongoing DAC dependency attorney and the First Call team will proactively encourage a successful and communicative relationship with the family’s DFCS social worker to support the goals of family reunification and family preservation.","In addition, program responsibilities include weekly case staffings with the interdisciplinary First Call team, networking and outreach to local community-based organizations, and ongoing data collection for purposes of evaluating and sustaining the program."],
